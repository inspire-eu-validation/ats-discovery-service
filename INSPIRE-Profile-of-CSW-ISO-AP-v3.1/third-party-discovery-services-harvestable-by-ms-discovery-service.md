# Third Party Discovery Services harvestable by MS Discovery Service

**Purpose**: Verification whether all information about the Public Authority’s or Third Party’s Discovery Service are provided, enabling the Member State Discovery Service to get resources metadata based on a combination of search criteria from the Public Authority’s or Third Party’s Discovery Service and to collate it with other resources metadata.

**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

Examine whether all information about the Public Authority’s or Third Party’s Discovery Service are provided, enabling the Member State Discovery Service to get resources metadata based on a combination of search criteria from the Public Authority’s or Third Party’s Discovery Service and to collate it with other resources metadata.

The requirement defines a mechanism that allows third parties to publish their Discovery Services to the INSPIRE network through a Member State Discovery Service. In general there are three possible
scenarios: 

* Centralised: the requirement is implicitly fulfilled.
* Discovery Client: the requirement is replaced with IR15 
* Discovery Service: the requirement is replaced by IR16 & 17 and fulfilled by test case [Federated Discovery Service](federated-discovery-service.md)


**Reference(s)**

* [TG DISC](README.md#ref_TG_DISC), Chapter 4.3.4, Implementation Requirement 14

**Test type**: Automated

**Notes** 

IR14 is a summary requirement, for which the actual implementation is covered by IR15-17 as referenced by the test method.
